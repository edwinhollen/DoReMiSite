			<h2>What is DoReMi?</h2>
			<p>
			DoReMi is a music puzzle game designed to promote music education and ear 
			training. DoReMi is an attempt to form an approachable bridge between ear training 
			in traditional/classical music education, and casual puzzle video game audiences.
			</p>
		
			<p>
			Players solve puzzles by listening to musical notes on a staff and 
			match pitches to form the correct solution. Puzzles range in difficulty between
			arpeggio solutions, major/minor solutions, and difficult chromatic solutions.
			</p>
			
			<p>DoReMi is designed to accommodate players of all ages, and players of all 
			(or no) levels of music education.</p>
